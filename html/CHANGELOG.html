<ul>
<li>The yabridge builds on the GitHub releases page now have the unity build
option disabled. This <em>may</em> work around the same Wine bug
<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53912" rel="nofollow">#53912</a> mentioned in the last
release, as the bug has not yet been fixed for Wine 7.22. Since this is a low
level bug within Wine, there's no guarantee that everything will work
correctly until the bug gets fixed. If you still experience crashes or freezes
with yabridge, then do consider
<a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#downgrading-wine">downgrading</a> back
to Wine Staging 7.20.</li>
<li>Yabridge's build system now errors out when enabling unity builds while
compiling with Wine 7.21 and 7.22.</li>

<ul>
<li>Changed the behavior when setting window positions for yabridge's editor. This
avoids a painfully slow redraw in the <em>Audio Nebula Aurora FM</em> plugin when
dragging the editor window around. The change may also help with other slow to
redraw GUI, and especially with window managers that send excessive events on
window movement like in Cinnamon and XFCE.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <code>--unity=on</code> build option should be removed for the time being as this
together with the VST3 SDK triggers the above mentioned <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53912" rel="nofollow">Wine

<code>yabridge-host.exe</code> (just that, with no <code>wine</code> in front of it) at least once
with Wine Staging 7.21 or 7.22 after building to make sure the build works
correctly. It should print a usage message if it does.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Yabridge 5.0 now supports bridging <a href="https://cleveraudio.org/" rel="nofollow">CLAP</a> plugins in
addition to its existing VST2 and VST3 plugin support. CLAP is a
<a href="https://github.com/free-audio/clap/blob/main/Contributors.md">collaborative
effort</a> by a
group of plugin and host developers of all backgrounds to create a
permissively licensed extensible plugin standard that is simple while also
catering to the needs of plugin developers, host developers, and musicians
alike. When bridged under yabridge, these plugins are likely to have lower
bridging overhead than their VST2 and VST3 counterparts while also being more
responsive and offering better support for instrument plugins and parameter
modulation.</p>
<p>Yabridge 5.0.0's CLAP bridging supports <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/blob/master/src/common/serialization/clap/README.md">all official CLAP 1.1
extensions</a>
except for the audio thread pool extension. Support for that extension will be
added in a future yabridge release as Windows-only plugins that rely on the
feature get released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desktop notifications no longer rely on the <code>notify-send</code> command line tool,
and are now sent by directly talking to D-Bus instead. This ensures that
you'll always see yabridge's notifications when something important happens,
even when using more niche distros where you may not have <code>notify-send</code>
installed by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new <code>editor_disable_host_scaling</code> <code>yabridge.toml</code> <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibility
option</a> lets
you prevent hosts from setting an explicit DPI scaling factor for a plugin's
editor. In some cases this can help with inconsistent scaling when using HiDPI
displays. This option affects both <strong>VST3</strong> and <strong>CLAP</strong> plugins and it
replaces the older <code>vst3_no_scaling</code> option.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are new <code>libyabridge-clap.so</code> and <code>libyabridge-chainloader-clap.so</code>
files need to be included in the package.</li>
<li>The new CLAP support requires version 1.1.2 of the CLAP headers because
earlier versions did not yet contain calling conventions.
(<a href="https://github.com/free-audio/clap/issues/153">https://github.com/free-audio/clap/issues/153</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/free-audio/clap/pull/154">https://github.com/free-audio/clap/pull/154</a>). Building against older
versions will result in memory errors.</li>
<li>The VST3 dependency is now at tag <code>v3.7.5_build_44-patched-2</code>. The only
difference with the previous <code>v3.7.5_build_44-patched</code> is a fixed version
number in the <code>meson.build</code> file.</li>
<li>The Meson build now requires the <code>libdbus-1</code> development package to be
installed. Yabridge's binaries don't dynamically link against the shared
library, but they do use the definitions from the headers to load
<code>libdbus-1.so.3</code> at runtime when it needs to send a desktop notification.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare edge case where a Windows VST3 plugin would incorrectly be
classified as a bundle-style plugin, which caused loading those plugins to
fail. This could happen if the directory <code>foo</code> contained some random
directory, containing another directory, containing <code>foo.vst3</code>. Yabridge
always assumed this to be a bundle, even if it was not.</li>
<li>Fixed Full Bucket's <em>Ragnarök</em> causing some hosts to freeze when changing
presets due to some mutually recursive function calls that weren't being
handled as such.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Parsing errors for plugin binaries are now non-fatal. This could happen if
your Windows plugin directories contain text files with a <code>.dll</code> or <code>.vst3</code>
file extension. This would normally never happen, but it can still happen if
you extracted those Windows plugins from a .zip file that was created on
macOS. Don't ask me how or why.</li>
<li>Prematurely abort the <code>yabridgectl sync</code> process if <code>~/.vst/yabridge</code> or
<code>~/.vst3/yabridge</code> are symlinks to a directory that's part of or contains one
of yabridgectl's plugin search directories. This prevents an edge cases where
VST2 plugin .dll files could be replaced by symlinks to themeselves.</li>
<li>Don't trigger a panic on <code>yabridgectl sync</code> if someone <code>yabridgectl add</code>'ed
the inner contents of a Windows VST3 bundle. For the record, you really,
really, <em>really</em> shouldn't be doing this.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed recent <em>Arturia</em> VST3 plugins running into memory errors at the end of a
plugin scan in <strong>REAPER</strong> and <strong>Ardour</strong>. These plugins would try to read data
in the Windows message loop without checking whether that data was
initialized, after the data had just been deinitialized.</li>

<ul>
<li>The new <code>system-asio</code> build option forces Asio to be used from the standard
include directories. Otherwise the dependency is defined as a regular Meson
dependency. Asio does not have any pkgconfig or CMake <a href="https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/issues/1071">build
definitions</a>, so it's
impossible to detect its presence and version in a standard way. Because of
that the Meson build will always fall back to using the included wrap
dependency. Configuring the project with
<code>meson setup build -Dsystem-asio=true ...</code> forces <code>&lt;asio.hpp&gt;</code> to be used
instead.</li>
<li>The <code>ghc_filesystem</code> dependency now explicitly mentions the
<code>ghcFilesystem::ghc_filesystem</code> CMake module. <code>ghc::filesystem</code>'s naming is
<a href="https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem/pull/129">inconsistent</a> so Meson can't
detect the correct module automatically. It also doesn't expose a
<a href="https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem/issues/148">version</a>, so even with this
change version 1.5.12 of the upstream dependency still won't be detected
correctly. There is a <a href="https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem/pull/149">PR</a> that
fixes this.</li>

<ul>
<li>Yabridge 4.0 completely revamps the way plugin loading works to allow yabridge
to be updated without breaking existing yabridge'd plugins while saving disk
space on filesystems that don't support reflinks and speeding up the
<code>yabridgectl sync</code> process. Up until this point, <code>yabridgectl sync</code> has always
made copies of yabridge's <code>libyabridge-vst2.so</code> or <code>libyabridge-vst3.so</code>
plugin libraries for every Windows plugin it sets up. These plugins are
tightly coupled to the yabridge plugin host binaries, and updating one but not
the other can thus cause issues. With yabridge 4.0, yabridgectl no longer
copies the entire plugin libraries. Instead, it now creates copies of these
new tiny dependencyless shim libraries. When loaded by a plugin host, these
libraries locate the actual plugin libraries on the system and then
transparently forward all entry point function calls to them as if the host
was loading the yabridge plugin library directly. Yabridge internally calls
these libraries chainloaders due to their similarity to the identically named
functionality in boot loading process. This allows yabridge to be updated
independently of these copied chainloading libraries. As such, it is no longer
possible for yabridge to be out of sync after an update. If you use a distro
packaged version of yabridge, then that means yabridge can now be updated
safely without requiring any action from your side.</li>
<li>Added support for the <code>effBeginLoadBank</code> and <code>effBeginLoadProgram</code> VST2
opcodes for loading state as a program or a program bank.</li>

<ul>
<li>Almost the entirety of yabridge's backend has been rewritten to get rid of all
dependencies on the Boost libraries. As a consequence, the runtime dependency
on <code>Boost.Filesystem</code> has also been removed. This makes packaging yabridge for
distros easier, and it makes the packages more reliable by removing the need
for yabridge to be rebuilt whenever Boost gets updated. Additionally, it also
makes compiling slightly faster and the binaries are slightly smaller.</li>
<li>The functionality for the <code>yabridge-group</code> binaries has been merged into the
<code>yabridge-host</code> binaries to reduce duplication.</li>
<li>When the user does not have the permissions to lock the shared audio buffers
into memory, yabridge will now retry mapping the memory without locking it
instead of immediately terminating the process. An annoying desktop
notification will still be shown every time you load a plugin until you fix
this however.</li>
<li>Yabridge now prints the path to the <code>libyabridge-{vst2,vst3}.so</code> library
that's being used on startup. This tells you where the chainloader is loading
the library file from. Because you can never have too much information, right?</li>
<li>The <code>with-bitbridge</code>, <code>with-vst3</code>, and <code>with-winedbg</code> build options have been
renamed to <code>bitbridge</code>, <code>vst3</code>, and <code>winedbg</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>effProcessEvents</code> VST2 calls are now filtered out from the log when
<code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> is set to 1.</li>

<li>Fixed yabridge throwing assertion failures on serialization when using some of
the <em>Orchestral Tools</em> Kontakt libraries in the VST2 version of Kontakt. Some
of those libraries would output more than 2048 MIDI events in a single buffer.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>VST2 plugins are now set up in <code>~/.vst/yabridge</code> by default. This means that
you no longer have to add any directory search locations in your DAW. The only
potential downside is that it's no longer possible for two plugin directories
(perhaps in different Wine prefixes) to provide the same plugin file, although
you would not have been able to use both with the same DAW anyways. Like with
yabridgectl's VST3 support, the subdirectory structure within the plugin
directory is preserved. You can use <code>yabridgectl set --vst2-location=inline</code>
to revert back to the old behavior of setting the plugins up right next to the
VST2 plugin <code>.dll</code> files. Some migration notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the plugins are now set up in <code>~/.vst/yabridge</code> by default instead
of next to the Windows VST2 plugin .dll file, you will see notices about
leftover <code>.so</code> files the first time you run <code>yabridgectl sync</code> after
updating. Double check the list to make sure there are no files in there
that shouldn't be removed, and then run <code>yabridgectl sync --prune</code> as
instructed to remove the old <code>.so</code> files.</li>
<li>Make sure your DAW searches for VST2 plugins in <code>~/.vst</code>.</li>
<li>You can and should remove any entries for VST2 plugin directories you added
to your DAW's plugin search locations as they will no longer contain any
relevant files.</li>
<li>If you were using a <code>yabridge.toml</code> configuration file to configure VST2
plugins, then you will now need to move that file in <code>~/.vst/yabridge</code>
instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned above, yabridgectl now uses the new chainloading libraries when
setting up plugins. This means that once you've ran <code>yabridgectl sync</code> after
updating to yabridge 4.0, yabridge can now be updated without needing to rerun
<code>yabridgectl sync</code>. This is particularly useful when using a distro packaged
version of yabridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for the new VST 3.7.5 <code>moduleinfo.json</code> format to allow VST3
plugins to replace VST2 and VST3 plugins with different class IDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yabridgectl no longer depends on <strong>winedump</strong>. It now parses Windows PE32(+)
binaries without requiring any external dependencies. Or at least, that's the
idea. I've come across at least one binary that this new parser can't handle
(<a href="https://github.com/m4b/goblin/issues/307">https://github.com/m4b/goblin/issues/307</a>), so it will still fall back to
winedump when that happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After <code>yabridgectl sync</code> has finished setting up plugins, yabridgectl now also
checks whether <code>notify-send</code> is installed as part of its post-installation
verification process. If <code>notify-send</code> is missing, then yabridge won't be able
to send any notifications when things are going terribly wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>yabridgectl status</code> now shows the locations where bridged VST2 and VST3
plugins will be set up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>yabridgectl sync --prune</code> now also considers broken symlinks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VST3 subdirectory detection has been made more robust and can now handle
arbitrary plugin directories, not just directories that are called <code>VST3</code>.
This, of course, should not be needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previously deprecated symlink installation method has been removed from
yabridgectl, along with the <code>yabridgectl set --method</code> option. The terminology
in <code>yabridgectl status</code> has changed accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>yabridgectl status</code> now lists the architecture of
<code>libyabridge-chainloader-vst2.so</code> just like it already did for the VST3
library.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the <strong>REAPER</strong>-specific <code>editor_force_dnd</code> option not working correctly
when using the <code>Track -&gt; Insert virtual instrument on new track...</code> option.
When using this option REAPER will first embed the plugin in an offscreen
plugin window and it will only then create the actual FX window and embed the
other window in it.</li>
<li>Fixed the VST3 version of <em>IK Multimedia's T-RackS 5</em> producing silent output
when doing offline rendering. This could happen when exporting or bouncing
audio in <strong>Bitwig Studio 4.1+</strong>, <strong>Ardour</strong> and in <strong>REAPER</strong>. These plugins
apparently need to process audio from the main GUI thread when in offline
rendering mode. If you try to process audio from the...audio thread, then they
will produce silence and hang afterwards (which a fix in yabridge 3.7.0
previously addressed).</li>
<li>Fixed crashes when opening plugin editors under <strong>Crostini</strong> on ChromeOS due

<li>Added support for VST3 plugins interacting directly with the host's context
menu items. Most plugins that use VST3's context menu support let the host
handle drawing the actual menu, but it's also possible for plugins to
incorporate the host's menu items into their own custom context menu. So far
this feature has only been tested with <a href="https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge">Surge

very few if any other plugins do this right now, but other plugins may start
doing this as well in the future.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed <em>Waves</em> V13 VST3 plugins crashing when opening the GUI. These plugins
thought it would be a great idea to randomly dereference null pointers if the
window they're embedded in is already visible. A day's worth of debugging well
spent. Even after this, the V13 plugins are a bit unstable under Wine in
general, and they will likely crash when reopening the editor a couple of
times or when removing them. So as always, if you can avoid Waves, that would
be for the best.</li>
<li>Fixed sluggish UIs in <em>Output's Thermal</em> and likely a handful of other
JUCE-based plugins with a lot of parameters. These plugins would emit hundreds
to thousands of events when the GUI changes. Yabridge now detects this, and
relaxes the throttling we have in place to prevent certain other plugins from
getting stuck in infinite loops.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>DrumCore 3</em> crashing when trying to drag grooves from the plugin to
other applications. This happened because of an integer underflow in that
plugin, causing the number of reported drag-and-drop formats to be magnitudes
higher than yabridge's indicated maximum.</li>
<li>Fixed Wine version detection in the build configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed VST3 connection point proxies not being disconnected properly. The code
path for this is not being used for any of the current Linux VST3 hosts, so
this won't have caused any issues.</li>
<li>Rewritten the VST3 object handling to prevent some theoretical data races when
the host inserts or removes plug instances while other instances of that
plugin are processing audio.</li>

<li>Yabridgectl's help text received some shiny new colors.</li>
<li>Disallowed adding individual files or symlinks to individual files with
<code>yabridgectl add</code>. Yabridgectl was never intended to be used that way and
while it does sort of work, it will lead to a number of surprises down the
line.</li>
<li>Deprecated support for the symlink-based installation method in yabridgectl
and removed all remaining mentions of it from the documentation. This feature
has for all intents and purposes already been made obselete in yabridge 2.1.0,
but the option still remained available. Enabling this option would lead to a
lot of surprises because of the way Linux's dynamic linker works. And with
modern file systems supporting reflinks and yabridge falling back to searching
for binaries in <code>~/.local/share/yabridge</code>, there's zero reason to use this
feature anymore. Yabridgectl will now print a warning upon syncing when the
symlink installation method has been enabled, and the feature will be removed
completely in yabridge 4.0.</li>

<li>All Meson wraps now use <code>wrap-git</code> instead of downloading tarballs from
GitHub. Previously the bitsery and function2 wraps would use source tarballs.</li>
<li>The <code>meson.build</code> patch overlays for the bitsery and function2 wraps are no
longer stored in tarballs committed to yabridge's repository. Instead, they
are now regular directories in the <code>subprojects/packagefiles</code> directory. This
means that building yabridge with these wraps now requires <strong>Meson 0.55</strong> or

<li>The bitsery wrap dependency was updated to version 5.2.2.</li>
<li>The function2 wrap dependency was updated to version 4.2.0.</li>

<ul>
<li>Yabridge will now also show annoying desktop notifications when encountering
low <code>RLIMIT_RTTIME</code> and <code>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</code> values. This can happen on systems
that have not yet been configured for pro audio work or with using an out of
the box PipeWire configuration. If these issues are not fixed, then certain
plugins may crash during initialization. Since these configuration issues may
not immediately cause any obvious problems, it's better to be upfront about it
so they can't cause mysterious issues later on. We would already print
warnings about this to the terminal, but those are easily missed when starting
a DAW from the GUI.</li>
<li>Added a new <code>editor_coordinate_hack</code> <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibility
option</a> to
replace <code>editor_double_embed</code>. This can be useful with buggy plugins that have
their editor GUIs misaligned after resizing the window. These plugins tend to
draw their GUI based on (top level) window's absolute screen coordinates
instead of their own relative position within the parent window. Some known
plugins that can benefit from this are <em>PSPaudioware E27</em> and <em>Soundtoys
Crystallizer</em>.</li>

Boost.Process that would cause yabridge to crash with an
<code>locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid</code> exception when (part of)
the current locale is invalid. This could happen on Arch Linux if you skipped
part of the Arch installation process.</li>
<li>Fixed New Sonic Arts' <em>Vice</em> plugin freezing when loading the plugin. This
happened because the plugin interacted with the GUI and tried to spawn new
threads when the host changes the sample rate or block size from the audio
thread. These things are now done from the main GUI thread, so please let me
know if there are any new loading issues with other VST2 plugins after this
update.</li>
<li>Fixed the drag-and-drop implementation not sending an <code>XdndStatus</code> message on
the very first tick. This fixes drag-and-drop from the <em>Samplab</em> plugin which
has a broken drag-and-drop implementation and only starts the operation after
the left mouse button has already been released.</li>

<li>You can now directly focus the plugin's editor instead of allowing the host to
process keyboard events by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while
entering a plugin's GUI with your mouse. Certain hosts like <strong>Bitwig Studio</strong>
normally still respond to common key presses like <kbd>Space</kbd> for
play/pause while interacting with a plugin. That in turn can make it
impossible to type a space character in those hosts, which may become a
problem when searching for or naming presets. With this feature you can
temporarily override this behaviour and allow all keyboard input to go
directly to Wine. This can also be useful for <em>Voxengo</em> plugins, which don't
grab input focus in their settings and license dialogs.</li>

<li>Yabridge will now handle X11 events from within the Win32 message loop. What
this means is that X11 events are now handled even when the plugin is blocking

any known situations where the old approach caused any issues).</li>

<ul>
<li>Reverted the workaround for the <em>Nimble Kick</em> plugin freezing added in
yabridge 3.5.0. This could cause VST3 plugins in <strong>Bitwig Studio</strong> and
<strong>Ardour</strong> to have frozen, nonfunctional editors when using multiple instances
of a plugin unless you opened every plugin instance's editor. Since the plugin
would also cause the native Windows version of Bitwig to crash, we will thus
simply revert this change.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression from yabridge 3.5.0 where clicking inside of a plugin GUI
while the window is already open in the background would not give keyboard
focus to the plugin.</li>
<li>Changed how input focus releasing works by more selectively filtering out
mouse pointer leave events where the pointer is still hovering over a Wine
window instead of ignoring an entire wider class of events. This should fix
some edge cases where input focus would not be given back to the host, or
where dropdown menus could close immediately when hovering over and them
leaving them with your mouse. The first case would in practice only happen
when using a touchscreen or drawing tablet, since it would require the mouse
to instantly move from the plugin GUI to another window without first going
over the window's borders.</li>
<li>Similarly, the filter in yabridge 3.5.0's Wine-&gt;X11 drag-and-drop
implementation for distinguishing between Wine windows and other windows (so
that we won't interfere with Wine's own internal drag-and-drop mechanism) has
also been made more specific. Before this change we might use our own
XDND-based drag-and-drop implementation when dragging files from a plugin to a
standalone Wine application running within the same Wine prefix.</li>

lot of inputs or outputs channels.</li>
<li>When this shared memory mapping fails because of a low value being set for
<code>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</code>, yabridge will now print a more specific error message
telling you about the issue and how to fix it.</li>
<li>Added a an optional <code>+editor</code> flag to the <code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> environment

<ul>
<li>The way editor embedding works has been rewritten. Yabridge now inserts a
wrapper window between the host's parent window and the embedded Wine window
instead of embedding the Wine window directly into the host. This should get
rid of all rare edge cases where the host would ignore the window size
reported by the plugin and would instead try to detect the plugin's size on
its own by intercepting configuration events sent to the Wine window. This
could cause the editor window to grow to fit the entire screen in certain
hosts under very specific circumstances.</li>
<li>We now support version 3 and 4 of the XDND specification for the Wine-&gt;X11
drag-and-drop support. Before this yabridge assumed every application
supported version 5 from 2002, but JUCE based hosts only support XDND version 3.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed crashes or freezes when a plugin uses the Windows drag-and-drop system
to transfer arbitrary, vendor specific data. This prevents <strong>Reaktor</strong> from
freezing when editing a patch after upgrading to yabridge 3.4.0.</li>
<li>Fixed yabridge thinking that the Wine plugin host process has died when the
user doesn't have permissions to access the Wine process's memory. This fixes
a seemingly very rare regression from yabridge 3.4.0 where the Wine plugin
host application would immediately be seen as dead when using <em>AppArmor</em>,
preventing yabridge from starting.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression from yabridge 3.4.0 where plugins with zero input and
output audio channels like FrozenPlain <strong>Obelisk</strong> would result in a crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression from yabridge 3.4.0 where JUCE-based VST3 plugins might
cause <strong>Ardour</strong> or <strong>Mixbus</strong> to freeze in very specific circumstances.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, it's now no longer possible for hosts to wrongly detect
the editor window size. This fixes a rare issue with <strong>Ardour</strong> on older XFCE
versions where the editor window would extend to cover the entire screen. A
similar issue also exists with <strong>Carla</strong> 2.3.1.</li>
<li>This same change also fixes VST3 editors in <strong>Ardour</strong> not rendering past
their original size when resizing them from the plugin (as opposed to resizing
the actual window).</li>
<li>Worked around a <strong>REAPER</strong> bug that would cause REAPER to not process any
keyboard input when the FX window is active but the mouse cursor is positioned
outside of the window. We now use the same validation used in <code>xprop</code> and
<code>xwininfo</code> to find the host's window instead of always taking the topmost
window.</li>
<li>Fixed Wine-&gt;X11 drag-and-drop in <strong>Tracktion Waveform</strong>. Waveform only
supports an old 1998 version of the XDND specification, so it was ignoring our
messages since we assumed every application would support the most recent XDND
version from 2002.</li>
<li>Worked around a race condition in <em>Nimble Kick</em>, which would trigger a stack
overflow when loading the plugin if it wasn't already activated.</li>
<li>Potentially fixed an obscure issue where the editor would not render at all
when using multiple displays and the rightmost display was set as the primary
display. This issue appears to be very rare, and I haven't gotten any response
back when I asked the people affected by this to test a potential fix, so I'm
just including it in yabridge anyways in case it helps. If anyone was affected
by this, please let me know if this update makes any difference!</li>

<code>yabridgectl status</code> now also lists the paths to the <code>yabridge-host.exe</code> and

<ul>
<li>Added support for drag-and-drop from Windows plugins running under yabridge to
native applications, such as your DAW. This makes it much more convenient to
use plugins like <em>Scaler 2</em> that generate audio or MIDI files. Because of the
way this is implemented this feature will work with any Wine version.</li>
<li>When a plugin fails to load or when the Wine plugin host process fails to
start, yabridge will now show you the error in a desktop notification instead
of only printing it to the logger. This will make it much faster to quickly
diagnose issues if you weren't already running your DAW from a terminal. These
notifications require <code>libnotify</code> and its <code>notify-send</code> application to be
installed.</li>
<li>Similarly, yabridge will show you a warning and a desktop notification with a
reminder to rerun <code>yabridgctl sync</code> when it detects that there's been a
version mismatch between the plugin and the used Wine plugin host application.</li>
<li>Added support for building 32-bit versions of the yabridge libraries, allowing
you to use both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2 and VST3 plugins under 32-bit
Linux plugin hosts. This should not be needed in any normal situation since
Desktop Linux has been 64-bit only for a while now, but it could be useful in
some very specific situations. Building on an actual 32-bit system will also
work, in which case the 64-bit Wine plugin host applications simply won't be
built.</li>
<li>Added the deprecated pre-VST2.4 <code>main</code> entry point for VST2 plugins. This
allows the above mentioned 32-bit version of yabridge to be used in
<strong>EnergyXT</strong>, allowing you to use both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2 plugins
there.</li>
<li>Added an environment variable to disable the watchdog timer. This is only
needed when running the Wine process under a separate namespace. If you don't
know that you need this, then you probably don't need this!</li>

<ul>
<li>The audio processing implementation for both VST2 and VST3 plugins has been
completely rewritten to use both shared memory and message passing to cut down
the number of expensive memory copies to a minimum. This reduces the DSP load
overhead of audio processing even further.</li>
<li>Respect <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> as a fallback when looking for yabridge's plugin host
binaries instead of hardcoding this to <code>~/.local/share/yabridge</code>. This matches
the existing behaviour in yabridgectl.</li>
<li>Optimized the management of VST3 plugin instances to reduce the overhead when
using many instances of a single VST3 plugin.</li>
<li>Slightly optimized the function call dispatch for VST2 plugins.</li>
<li>Prevented some more potential unnecessary memory operations during yabridge's
communication. The underlying serialization library was recreating some
objects even when this wasn't needed, which could result in unnecessary memory
allocations under certain circumstances. This is related to the similar issue
that was fixed in yabridge 3.3.0. A fix for this issue has also been
upstreamed to the library.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse cursors disappearing when interacting with some plugin GUIs. This
often happened with <em>JUCE</em> based plugins, such as Sonic Academy's <em>Kick 2</em> and
<em>Anaglyph</em>. While this is technically a workaround for a bad interaction
between JUCE and Wine, it should make these plugins much more pleasant to use.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Waves</em> VST3 plugins not being able to initialize correctly. These
plugins would at runtime change their query interface to support more VST3
interfaces, including the mandatory edit controller interface. Yabridge now
requeries the supported interfaces at a later stage to work around this.</li>
<li>Fixed VST2 plugins in <strong>Ardour</strong> not receiving all transport information,
breaking host sync and LFOs in certain plugins. This was a regression from
yabridge 3.2.0.</li>
<li>Fixed input focus handling being broken <strong>REAPER</strong> after reopning a closed FX
window. Now moving the mouse cursor outside of the plugin's GUI will always
release input focus, even after closing the window.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Insert Piz Here</em>'s <em>midiLooper</em> crashing in <strong>REAPER</strong> when the plugin
tries to use REAPER's <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/vst/vst_ext.php#vst_host" rel="nofollow">host function
API</a>. This currently isn't
supported by yabridge. We now explicitly ignore these requests.</li>
<li>Worked around a rare thread safety issue in <em>MeldaProduction</em> VST3 plugins
where the plugin would deadlock when the host asks for the editor's size while
plugin is also being initialized from the audio thread at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed JUCE VST3 plugins like Tokyo Dawn Records' <em>SlickEQ M</em> causing the host
to freeze when they send a parameter change from the audio thread using the
wrong VST3 API while the plugin is also trying to resize the window from the
GUI thread at the same time. This would happen in <em>SlickEQ M</em> when reopning
the Smart Ops panel after having used it once. To fix this, yabridge's
Wine-side VST3 mutual recursion mechanism now only operates when invoked from
the GUI thread.</li>
<li>Fixed yabridge's logging seeking the STDERR stream to position 0 every time it
writes a log message. This would be noticeable when piping the host's STDERR
stream to a file and <code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> wasn't set.</li>
<li>When printing the Wine version during initialization, the Wine process used
for this is now run under the same environment that the Wine plugin host
process will be run under. This means that if you use a custom <code>WINELOADER</code>
script to use different Wine versions depending on the prefix,
the <code>wine version:</code> line in the initialization message will now always match
the version of Wine the plugin is going to be run under.</li>
<li>Fixed the plugin-side watchdog timer that allows a yabridge plugin to
terminate when the Wine plugin host application fails to start treating zombie
processes as still running, active processes. This could cause plugins to hang
during scanning if the Wine process crashed in a very specific and likely
impossible way.</li>
<li>If a VST3 plugin returns a null pointer from <code>IEditController::createView()</code>,
then this will now be propagated correctly on the plugin side.</li>
<li>Fixed VST2 speaker arrangement configurations returned by the plugin not being
serialized correctly. Very few plugins and hosts seem to actually use these,
so it should not have caused any issues.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added support for setting up merged VST3 bundles when using a 32-bit version
of <code>libyabridge-vst3.so</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed the post-installation setup checks when the default Wine prefix over at
<code>~/.wine</code> was created with <code>WINEARCH=win32</code> set. This would otherwise result
in an <code>00cc:err:process:exec_process</code> error when running <code>yabridgectl sync</code>
because yabridgectl would try to run the 64-bit <code>yabridge-host.exe</code> in that
prefix. Yabridgectl now detects the architecture of the default prefix first
and then runs the proper Wine plugin host application for that prefix.</li>
<li>Copies of <code>libyabridge-vst2.so</code> and <code>libyabridge-vst3.so</code> are now reflinked
when supported by the file system. This speeds up the file coyping process
while also reducing the amount of disk space used for yabridge when using
Btrfs or XFS.</li>
<li>If pruning causes a directory to be empty, then the empty directory will now
also be removed. This avoids having your plugin directories littered with
empty directories.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect new and total plugin counts. These counts are now always
correct, even when using multiple versions of the same VST3 plugin or when
multiple plugin directories overlap because of the use of symlinks.</li>
<li>Aside from pruning only unmanaged VST3 bundles in <code>~/.vst3/yabridge</code>, yabridge
will now also prompt you to prune leftover files from within a managed VST3
bundle. This makes it easy to switch from the 64-bit version of a plugin to
the 32-bit version, or from a 64-bit version of yabridge to the 32-bit
version. I don't know why you would want to do either of those things, but now
you can!</li>
<li>Yabridgectl now prints a more descriptive error message instead of panicing if
running <code>$WINELOADER --version</code> during yabridgectl's post-setup verification
checks does not result in any output. This is only relevant when using a
custom <code>WINELOADER</code> script that modifies Wine's output.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the <code>IPlugView::canResize()</code> cache added in yabridge 3.2.0 sometimes not
being initialized properly, preventing host-driven resizes in certain
situations. This was mostly noticeable in <strong>Ardour</strong>.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse clicks in VST2 editors in <strong>Tracktion Waveform</strong> being offset
vertically by a small amount because of the way Waveform embeds VST2 editors.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Shattered Glass Audio</em> plugins crashing when opening the plugin editor
because those plugins don't initialize Microsoft COM before trying to use it.
We now always initialize the Microsoft COM library unconditionally, instead of
doing it only when a plugin fails to initialize without it.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect version strings being reported by yabridge when building from
a tarball that has been extracted inside of an unrelated git repository. This
could happen when building the <code>yabridge</code> AUR package with certain AUR

redirect the Wine plugin host's STDOUT and STDERR output streams directly to a

Gorilla Engine, such as the <em>LoopCloud</em> plugins, to function correctly. Those
plugins crash with a seemingly unrelated error message when their output is
redirected to a pipe.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added a timed cache for the <code>IPlugView::canResize()</code> VST3 function so the
result will be remembered during an active resize. This makes resizing VST3
plugin editor windows more responsive.</li>
<li>Added another cache for when the host asks a VST3 plugin whether it supports
processing 32-bit or 64-bit floating point audio. Some hosts, like <strong>Bitwig
Studio</strong>, call this function at the start of every processing cycle even
though the value won't ever change. Caching this can significantly reduce the
overhead of bridging VST3 plugins under those hosts.</li>
<li>Redesigned the VST3 audio socket handling to be able to reuse the process data
objects on both sides. This greatly reduces the overhead of our VST3 bridging
by getting rid of all potential memory allocations during audio processing.</li>
<li>VST2 audio processing also received the same optimizations. In a few places
yabridge would still reallocate heap data during every audio processing cycle.
We now make sure to always reuse all buffers and heap data used in the audio
processing process.</li>
<li>Considerably optimized parts of yabridge's communication infrastructure by
preventing unnecessary memory operations. As it turned out, the underlying
binary serialization library used by yabridge would always reinitialize the
type-safe unions yabridge uses to differentiate between single and double
precision floating point audio buffers in both VST2 and VST3 plugins, undoing
all of our efforts at reusing objects and preventing memory allocations in the
process. A fix for this issue has also been upstreamed to the library.</li>
<li>VST3 output audio buffers are now no longer zeroed out at the start of every
audio processing cycle. We've been doing this for VST3 plugins since the
introduction of VST3 bridging in yabridge 3.0.0, but we never did this for
VST2 plugins. Since not doing this has never caused any issues with VST2
plugins, it should also be safe to also skip this for VST3 plugins. This
further reduces the overhead of VST3 audio processing.</li>
<li>Optimized VST3 audio processing for instruments by preallocating small vectors
for event and parameter change queues.</li>
<li>VST2 MIDI event handling also received the same small vector optimization to
get rid of any last potential allocations during audio processing.</li>
<li>This small vector optimization has also been applied across yabridge's entire
communication and event handling architecture, meaning that most plugin
function calls and callbacks should no longer produce any allocations for both
VST2 and VST3 plugins.</li>
<li>Changed the way mutual recursion in VST3 plugins on the plugin side works to
counter any potential GUI related timing issues with VST3 plugins when using
multiple instances of a plugin.</li>
<li>Changed the way realtime scheduling is used on the Wine side to be less
aggressive, potentially reducing CPU usage when plugins are idle.</li>
<li>The deserialization part of yabridge's communication is now slightly faster by
skipping some unnecessary checks.</li>
<li>Log messages about VST3 query interfaces are now only printed when
<code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> is set to 2 or higher, up from 1.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a longstanding thread safety issue when hosting a lot of VST2 plugins in
a plugin group. This could cause plugins to crash or freeze when initializing
a new instance of a VST2 plugin in a plugin group while another VST2 plugin in
that same group is currently processing audio.</li>
<li>Fixed yabridge's Wine processes inheriting file descriptors in some
situations. This could cause <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong> to hang when reopening
the DAW after a crash. The watchdog timer added in yabridge 3.2.0 addressed
this issue partially, but it should now be completely fixed. This may also
prevent rare issues where the <strong>JACK</strong> server would hang after the host
crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>DMG</em> VST3 plugins freezing in <strong>REAPER</strong> when the plugin resizes itself
while the host passes channel context information to the plugin.</li>
<li>Also fixed <em>DMG</em> VST3 plugins freezing in <strong>REAPER</strong> when restoring multiple
instances of the plugin at once while the FX window is open and the GUI is
visible.</li>
<li>Fixed the <em>PG-8X</em> VST2 plugin freezing in <strong>REAPER</strong> when loading the plugin.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Voxengo</em> VST2 plugins freezing in <strong>Renoise</strong> when loading a project or
when otherwise restoring plugin state.</li>
<li>Fixed logging traces in the VST2 audio processing functions and the VST3 query

<ul>
<li>During VST2 audio processing, yabridge will now prefetch the current transport
information and process level before sending the audio buffers over to the
Windows VST2 plugin. This lets us cache this information on the Wine side
during the audio processing call, which significantly reduces the overhead of
bridging VST2 plugins by avoiding one or more otherwise unavoidable back and
forth function calls between yabridge's native plugin and the Wine plugin
host. While beneficial to every VST2 plugin, this considerably reduces the
overhead of bridging <em>MeldaProduction</em> VST2 plugins, and it has an even
greater impact on plugins like <em>SWAM Cello</em> that request this information
repeatedly over the course of a single audio processing cycle. Previously
yabridge had a <code>cache_time_info</code> compatibility option to mitigate the
performance hit for those plugins, but this new caching behaviour supercedes
that option.</li>
<li>We now always force the CPU's flush-to-zero flag to be set when processing
audio. Most plugins will already do this by themselves, but plugins like <em>Kush
Audio REDDI</em> and <em>Expressive E Noisy</em> that don't will otherwise suffer from
extreme DSP usage increases when processing almost silent audio.</li>
<li>Added a new <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibility
option</a> to hide
the name of the DAW you're using. This can be useful with plugins that have
undesirable or broken DAW-specific behaviour. See the <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#known-issues-and-fixes">known
issues</a>
section of the readme for more information on when this may be useful.</li>
<li>Yabridge now uses a watchdog timer to prevent rare instances where Wine
processes would be left running after the native host has crashed or when it
got forcefully terminated. By design yabridge would always try to gracefully
shut down its Wine processes when native host has crashed and the sockets
become unavailable, but this did not always happen if the crash occurred
before the bridged plugin has finished initializing because of the way Unix
Domain Sockets work. In that specific situation the <code>yabridge-host.exe</code>
process would be left running indefinitely, and depending on your DAW that
might have also prevented you from actually restarting your DAW without
running <code>wineserver -k</code> first. To prevent any more dangling processes,
yabridge's Wine plugin hosts now have a watchdog timer that periodically
checks whether the original process that spawned the bridges is still running.
If it detects that the process is no longer alive, yabridge will close the
sockets and shut down the bridged plugin to prevent any more dangling
processes from sticking around.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most common VST2 functions that don't have any arguments are now handled
explicilty. Yabridge could always automatically support most VST2 functions by
simply inspecting the function arguments and handling those accordingly. This
works practically everywhere, but <em>Plugsound Free</em> by UVI would sometimes pass
unreadable function arguments to functions that weren't supposed to have any
arguments, causing yabridge to crash. Explicitly handling those functions
should prevent similar situations from happening in the future.</li>
<li>Yabridge will now try to bypass VST3 connection proxies if possible. Instead
of connecting two VST3 plugin objects directly, <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong>
place a connection proxy between the two plugin objects so that they can only
interact indirectly through the DAW. In the past yabridge has always honored
this by proxying the host's connection proxy, but this causes difficult
situations with plugins that actively communicate over these proxies from the
GUI thread, like the <em>FabFilter</em> plugins. Whenever possible, yabridge will now
try to bypass the connection proxies and connect the two objects directly
instead, only falling back to proxying the proxies when that's not possible.</li>
<li>Compile times have been slightly lowered by compiling most of the Wine plugin
host into static libraries first.</li>
<li>When building the package from source, the targetted Wine version now gets
printed at configure-time. This can make it a bit easier to diagnose
Wine-related compilation issues.</li>

<ul>
<li>The <code>cache_time_info</code> compatibility option has been removed since it's now
obsolete.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed rare X11 errors that could occur when closing a plugin's editor. In
certain circumstances, closing a plugin editor would trigger an X11 error and
crash the Wine plugin host, and with that likely the entire DAW. This happened
because Wine would try to destroy the window after it had already been
destroyed. This could happen in Renoise and to a lesser degree in REAPER with
plugins that take a while to close their editors, such as the <em>iZotope Rx</em>
plugins. We now explicitly reparent the window to back the root window first
before deferring the window closing. This should fix the issue, while still
keeping editor closing nice and snappy.</li>
<li>Plugin group host processes now shut down by themselves if they don't get a
request to host any plugins within five seconds. This can happen when the DAW
gets killed right after starting the group host process but before the native
yabridge plugin requests the group host process to host a plugin for them.
Before this change, this would result in a <code>yabridge-group.exe</code> process
staying around indefinitely.</li>
<li>Prevented latency introducing VST3 from freezing <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong>
when loading the plugin. This stops <em>Neural DSP Darkglass</em> from freezing when
used under those DAWs.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>FabFilter</em> VST3 plugins freezing in <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong> when
trying to duplicate existing instances of the plugin after the editor GUI has
been opened.</li>
<li>Fixed VST3 plugins freezing in <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong> when the plugin tries
to automate a parameter while loading a preset.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Voxengo</em> VST3 plugins freezing in <strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong> when
loading a project or when duplicating the plugin instances.</li>
<li>Fixed potential X11 errors resulting in assertion failures and crashes in
<strong>Ardour</strong> and <strong>Mixbus</strong> when those hosts hide (unmap) a plugin's editor
window.</li>
<li>Fixed saving and loading plugin state for VST3 <em>iZotope Rx</em> plugins in
<strong>Bitwig Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression from yabridge 3.1.0 where <strong>REAPER</strong> would freeze when opening
a VST3 plugin context menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential freezing issue in <strong>REAPER</strong> that could happen when a VST3
plugin resizes itself while sending parameter changes to the host when
REAPER's 'disable saving full plug-in state' option has not been disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed another potential freeze when loading a VST3 plugin preset while the
editor is open when the plugin tries to resize itself based on that new
preset.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential assertion failure when loading VST3 presets. This would
depend on the compiler settings and the version of <code>libstdc++</code> used to built
yabridge with.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>PSPaudioware InifniStrip</em> failing to initialize. The plugin expects the
host to always be using Microsoft COM, and it doesn't try to initialize it by
itself. InfiniStrip loads as expected now.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>Native Instruments' FM7</em> crashing when processing MIDI. In order to fix
this, MIDI events are now deallocated later then when they normally would have
to be.</li>
<li>Fixed extreme DSP usage increases in <em>Kush Audio REDDI</em> and <em>Expressive E
Noisy</em> due to denormals.</li>
<li>Fixed the VST3 version of <em>W. A. Production ImPerfect</em> crashing during audio
setup.</li>
<li>Fixed <em>UVI Plugsound Free</em> crashing during initialization.</li>
<li>Fixed the Wine version detection when using a custom <code>WINELOADER</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect logging output for cached VST3 function calls.</li>
<li>Because of the new VST2 transport information prefetching, the excessive DSP
usage in <em>SWAM Cello</em> has now been fixed without requiring any manual
compatibility options.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added support for using 32-bit Windows VST3 plugins in 64-bit Linux VST3
hosts. This had previously been disabled because of a hard to track down
corruption issue.</li>
<li>Added an
<a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">option</a> to
prefer the 32-bit version of a VST3 plugin over the 64-bit version if both are
installed. This likely won't be necessary, but because of the way VST3 bundles
work there's no clean way to separate these. So when both are installed, the
64-bit version gets used by default.</li>

<li>Worked around a regression in Wine 6.5 that would prevent yabridge from
shutting down (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50869" rel="nofollow">wine bug
#50869</a>). With Wine 6.5
terminating a Wine process no longer terminates its threads, which would cause
yabridge's plugin and host components to wait for each other to shut down.</li>
<li>Fixed preset/state loading in both the VST2 and VST3 versions of <em>Algonaut
Atlas 2.0</em> by loading and saving plugin state from the main GUI thread.</li>
<li>Added a workaround for a bug present in every current <em>Bluecat Audio</em> VST3
plugin. Those plugins would otherwise crash yabridge because they didn't
directly expose a core VST3 interface through their query interface.</li>
<li>Fixed a multithreading related memory error in the VST3 audio processor socket

<li>The VST3 SDK Meson wrap dependency and the patches in

<ul>
<li>Wine 6.2 introduced a

compile errors because some parts of Wine's headers were no longer valid C++.

<ul>
<li>Yabridge 3.0 introduces the first ever true Wine VST3 bridge, allowing you to
use Windows VST3 plugins in Linux VST3 hosts with full VST 3.7.1
compatibility. Simply tell yabridgectl to look for plugins in
<code>$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/VST3</code>, run <code>yabridgectl sync</code>,
and your VST3 compatible DAW will pick up the new plugins in
<code>~/.vst3/yabridge</code> automatically. Even though this feature has been tested
extensively with a variety of VST3 plugins and hosts, there's still a
substantial part of the VST 3.7.1 specification that isn't used by any of the
hosts or plugins we could get our hands on, so please let me know if you run
into any weird behaviour! There's a list in the readme with all of the tested
hosts and their current VST3 compatibility status.</li>
<li>Added an
<a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">option</a> to use
Wine's XEmbed implementation instead of yabridge's normal window embedding
method. This can help reduce flickering when dragging the window around with
certain window managers. Some plugins will have redrawing issues when using
XEmbed or the editor might not show up at all, so your mileage may very much
vary.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibilty
option</a> to
forcefully enable drag-and-drop support under <em>REAPER</em>. REAPER's FX window
reports that it supports drag-and-drop itself, which makes it impossible to
drag files onto a plugin editor embedded there. This option strips the
drag-and-drop support from the FX window, thus allowing you to drag files onto
plugin editors again.</li>
<li>Added a frame rate
<a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">option</a> to
change the rate at which events are being handled. This usually also controls
the refresh rate of a plugin's editor GUI. The default 60 updates per second
may be too high if your computer's cannot keep up, or if you're using a host
that never closes the editor such as <em>Ardour</em>.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibility
option</a> to
disable HiDPI scaling for VST3 plugins. At the moment Wine does not have
proper fractional HiDPI support, so some plugins may not scale their
interfaces correctly when the host tells those plugins to scale their GUIs. In
some cases setting the font DPI in <code>winecfg</code>'s graphics tab to 192 will also
cause the GUIs to scale correctly at 200%.</li>
<li>Added the <code>with-vst3</code> compile time option to control whether yabridge should
be built with VST3 support. This is enabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>libyabridge.so</code> is now called <code>libyabridge-vst2.so</code>. If you're using
yabridgectl then nothing changes here. <strong>To avoid any potential confusion in
the future, please remove the old <code>libyabridge.so</code> file before upgrading.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The release archives uploaded on GitHub are now repackaged to include
yabridgectl for your convenience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Window closing is now deferred. This means that when closing the editor
window, the host no longer has to wait for Wine to fully close the window.
Most hosts already do something similar themselves, so this may not always
make a difference in responsiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly increased responsiveness when resizing plugin GUIs by preventing
unnecessary blitting. This also reduces flickering with plugins that don't do
double buffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VST2 editor idle events are now handled slightly differently. This should
result in even more responsive GUIs for VST2 plugins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win32 and X11 events in the Wine plugin host are now handled with lower
scheduling priority than other tasks. This might help get rid of potential DSP
latency spikes when having the editor open while the plugin is doing expensive
GUI operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening and closing plugin editors is now also no longer done with realtime
priority. This should get rid of any latency spikes during those operations,
as this could otherwise steal resources away from the threads that are
processing audio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way realtime priorities assigned has been overhauled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realtime scheduling on the plugin side is now a more granular. Instead of
setting everything to use <code>SCHED_FIFO</code>, only the spawned threads will be
configured to use realtime scheduling. This prevents changing the scheduling
policy of your host's GUI thread if your host instantiates plugins from its
GUI thread like <em>REAPER</em> does.</li>
<li>Relaying messages printed by the plugin and Wine is now done without
realtime priority, as this could in theory cause issues with plugins that
produce a steady stream of fixmes or other output.</li>
<li>The realtime scheduling priorities of all audio threads in the Wine plugin
host are now periodically synchronized with those of the host's audio
threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using <code>yabridge.toml</code> config files, the matched section or glob pattern
is now also printed next to the path to the file to make it a bit easier to
see where settings are being set from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture document has been updated for the VST3 support and it has
been rewritten to talk more about the more interesting bits of yabridge's
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part of the build process has been changed to account for <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49138" rel="nofollow">this Wine
bug</a>. Building with Wine 5.7
and 5.8 required a change for <code>yabridge-host.exe</code> to continue working, but
that change now also breaks builds using Wine 6.0 and up. The build process
now detects which version of Wine is used to build with, and it will then
apply the change conditionally based on that to be able to support building
with both older and newer versions of Wine. This does mean that when you
switch to an older Wine version, you might need to run
<code>meson setup build --reconfigure</code> before rebuilding to make sure that these
changes take effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>yabridge-host.exe</code> will no longer remove the socket directories if they're
outside of a temporary directory. This could otherwise cause a very unpleasant
surprise if someone were to pass random arguments to it when for instance
trying to write a wrapper around <code>yabridge-host.exe</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> is set to 2 or higher and a plugin asks the host
for the current position in the song, yabridge will now also print the current
tempo to help debugging host bugs.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>VST2 plugin editor resizing in <strong>REAPER</strong> would not cause the FX window to be
resized like it would in every other host. This has now been fixed.</li>
<li>The function for suspending and resuming audio, <code>effMainsChanged()</code>, is now
always executed from the GUI thread. This fixes <strong>EZdrummer</strong> not producing
any sound because the plugin makes the incorrect assumption that
<code>effMainsChanged()</code> is always called from the GUI thread.</li>
<li>Event handling is now temporarily disabled while plugins are in a partially
initialized state. The VST2 versions of <strong>T-RackS 5</strong> would have a chance to
hang indefinitely if the event loop was being run before those plugins were
fully initialized because of a race condition within those plugins. This issue
was only noticeable when using plugin groups.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where an interaction between <em>Bitwig Studio</em> and
yabridge's input focus grabbing method could cause delayed mouse events when
clicking on a plugin's GUI in Bitwig. This issue has not been reported for
yabridge 2.2.1 and below, but it could in theory also affect older versions of
yabridge.</li>

<ul>
<li>Updated for the changes in yabridge 3.0. Yabridgectl now allows you to set up
yabridge for VST3 plugins. Since <code>libyabridge.so</code> got renamed to
<code>libyabridge-vst2.so</code> in this version, it's advised to carefully remove the
old <code>libyabridge.so</code> and <code>yabridgectl</code> files before upgrading to avoid
confusing situations.</li>
<li>Added the <code>yabridgectl set --path-auto</code> option to revert back to automatically
locating yabridge's files after manually setting a path with
<code>yabridgectl set --path=&lt;...&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Added the <code>yabridgectl set --no-verify={true,false}</code> option to permanently
disable post-installation setup checks. You can still directly pass the
<code>--no-verify</code> argument to <code>yabridgectl sync</code> to disable these checks for only
a single invocation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added an option to cache the time and tempo info returned by the host for the
current processing cycle. This would normally not be needed since plugins
should ask the host for this information only once per audio callback, but a
bug in <em>SWAM Cello</em> causes this to happen repeatedly for every sample,
resutling in very bad performance. See the <a href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge#compatibility-options">compatibility

<ul>
<li>When <code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> is set to 2 or higher and a plugin asks the host
for the current position in the song, yabridge will now print that position in
quarter notes and samples as part of the debug output.</li>
<li>
<code>YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</code> 2 will now also cause all audio processing callbacks to
be logged. This makes recognizing misbheaving plugins a bit easier.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where in certain situations Wine processes were left running
after the host got forcefully terminated before it got a chance to tell the
plugin to shut down. This could happen when using Kontakt in Bitwig, as Bitwig
sets a limit on the amount of time a plugin is allowed to spend closing when
you close Bitwig, and Kontakt can take a while to shut down.</li>

lot of changes and that a single

<li>Yabridge will now always search for <code>yabridge-host.exe</code> in
<code>~/.local/share/yabridge</code> even if that directory is not in the search path.
This should make setup easier, since you no longer have to modify any
environment variables when installing yabridge to the default location.
Because of this, the symlink-based installation method does not have a lot of

<ul>
<li>
<p>The way communication works in yabridge has been completely redesigned to be
fully concurrent and to use additional threads as necessary. This was needed
to allow yabridge to handle nested and mutually recursive function calls as
well as several other edge cases a synchronous non-concurrent implementation
would fail. What this boils down to is that yabridge became even faster, more
responsive, and can now handle many scenarios that would previously require
workarounds. The most noticeable effects of these changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>hack_reaper_update_display</code> workaround for <em>REAPER</em> and <em>Renoise</em> to
prevent certain plugins from freezing is no longer needed and has been
removed.</li>
<li>Opening and scanning plugins becomes much faster in several VST hosts
because more work can be done simultaneously.</li>
<li>Certain plugins, such as Kontakt, no longer interrupt audio playback in
Bitwig while their editor was being opened.</li>
<li>Any loading issues in Bitwig Studio 3.3 beta 1 are no longer present.</li>
<li>Hosting a yabridged plugin inside of the VST2 version of Carla now works as
expected.</li>
<li>And probably many more improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from these more noticeable changes, this has also made it possible to
remove a lot of older checks and behaviour that existed solely to work around
the limitations introduced by the old event handling system. I have been
testing this extensively to make sure that these changes don't not introduce
any regressions, but please let me know if this did break anything for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>The way the Wine process handles threading has also been completely reworked
as part of the communication rework.</li>
<li>GUI updates for plugins that don't use hardware acceleration are now run at 60
Hz instead of 30 Hz. This was kept at 30 updates per second because that
seemed to be a typical rate for Windows VST hosts and because function calls
could not be processed while the GUI was being updated, but since that
limitation now no longer exists we can safely bump this up.</li>
<li>Sockets are now created in <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> (which is <code>/run/user/&lt;user_id&gt;</code>
on most systems) instead of <code>/tmp</code> to avoid polluting <code>/tmp</code>.</li>

<ul>
<li>The now obsolete <code>hack_reaper_update_display</code> option has been removed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a very long standing issue with plugins groups where unloading a plugin
could cause a crash. Now you can host over a hundred plugins in a single
process without any issues.</li>
<li>Fixed another edge case with plugin groups when simultaneously opening
multiple plugins within the same group. The fallover behaviour that would
cause all of those plugins to eventually connect to a single group host
process would sometimes not work correctly because the plugins were being
terminated prematurely.</li>
<li>Fixed the implementation of the accumulative <code>process()</code> function. As far as
I'm aware no VST hosts made in the last few decades even use this, but it just
feels wrong to have an incorrect implementation as part of yabridge.</li>

<ul>
<li>When running <code>yabridgectl sync</code>, existing .so files will no longer be

after setting up a single new plugin through yabridgectl. Running
<code>yabridgectl sync</code> after updating yabridge will still recreate all existing
.so files as usual.</li>
<li>Added a <code>--force</code> option to <code>yabridgectl sync</code> to always recreate all existing

<ul>
<li>
<p>The way keyboard input works has been completely rewritten to be more reliable
in certain hosts and to provide a more integrated experience. Hovering over
the plugin's editor while the window provided by the host is active will now
immediately grab keyboard focus, and yabridge will return input focus to the
host's window when moving the mouse outside of the plugin's editor when the
window is still active. This should fix some instances where keyboard input
was not working in hosts with more complex editor windows like <em>REAPER</em> and
<em>Ardour</em>, and it also allows things like the comment field in REAPER's FX
window to still function.</p>
<p>A consequence of this change is that pressing Space in Bitwig Studio 3.2 will
now play or pause playback as intended, but this does mean that it can be
impossible to type the space character in text boxes inside of a plugin editor
window. Please let me know if this causes any issues for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both unrecognized and invalid options are now printed on started to make
debugging <code>yabridge.toml</code> files easier.</p>

<ul>
<li>Both parts of yabridge will now run with realtime priority if available. This
can significantly reduce overall latency and spikes. Wine itself will still
run with a normal scheduling policy by default, since running wineserver with
realtime priority can actually increase the audio processing latency although
it does reduce the amount of latency spikes even further. You can verify that
yabridge is running with realtime priority by looking for the <code>realtime:</code> line
in the initialization message. I have not found any downsides to this approach
in my testing, but please let me know if this does end up causing any issues.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added a workaround for the compilation issues under Wine 5.7 and above as
caused by <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49138" rel="nofollow">Wine bug #49138</a>.</li>
<li>Added a workaround for plugins that improperly defer part of their
initialization process without telling the host. This fixes startup behavior
for the Roland Cloud plugins.</li>
<li>Added a workaround for a rare race condition in certain plugins caused by
incorrect assumptions in plugin's editor handling. Fixes the editor for
Superior Drummer 3 and the Roland Cloud synths in Bitwig Studio.</li>

<ul>
<li>Added support for plugins that send MIDI events back to the host. This allows
plugins such as Cthulhu and Scaler to output notes and CC for another plugin
to work with.</li>
<li>Added support for querying and setting detailed information about speaker
configurations for use in advanced surround setups. This indirectly allows
yabridge to work under <em>Renoise</em>.</li>
<li>Added automated development builds for yabridge, available by clicking on the
'Automated builds' badge in the project readme.</li>

<ul>
<li>Changed the plugin detection mechanism to support yet another way of
symlinking plugins. Now you can use a symlink to a copy of <code>libyabridge.so</code>
that's installed for a plugin in another directory. This is not recommended
though.</li>
<li>Changed Wine prefix detection to be relative to the plugin's <code>.dll</code> file,
rather than the loaded <code>.so</code> file.</li>
<li>Increased the maximum number of audio channels from 32 to 256.</li>
<li>Clarified the error that appears when we're unable to load the <code>.dll</code>.</li>
<li>Yabridge will now print the used version of Wine during startup. This can be
useful for diagnosing startup problems.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed plugins failing to load on certain versions of <em>Ubuntu</em> because of
paths starting with two forward slashes.</li>
<li>Redirect the output from the Wine host process earlier in the startup process.
Otherwise errors printed during startup won't be visible, making it very hard
to diagnose problems.</li>
